    Calculates the mean and inverse standard deviation of the input
    along the last dimension.

    Args:
        input: Input whose mean and inverse standard deviation are calculated.
            The input must be of shape [BLOCK_SIZE1, BLOCK_SIZE2].
        last_dim: Size of the last dimension of input.
        eps: Epsilon added in the square root in the denominator
            to avoid division by zero.

            which elements should be included in the calculations.
